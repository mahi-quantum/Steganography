# Steganography

Steganography is the art of concealing a secret message within (or even on top of) a non-secret object. That something can be anything you want it to be. Many forms of steganography nowadays involve hiding a secret piece of text within a photograph. Alternatively, you may hide a secret message or script inside a Word or Excel document. 

Steganography's goal is to conceal and deceive. It is a type of covert communication in which messages are hidden using any media. It isn't cryptography because it doesn't encrypt data or require the usage of a key. Instead, it's a type of data concealment that can be done in a variety of ways. Steganography is a practise that enables secrecy – and deception – in the same way that cryptography is a science that mostly enables privacy.
